iScan
=====

Hello, iScan is a natively coded Android Application that scans Barcodes and QR Codes. The app uses the Camera of the phone to Scan the code in the front of you and then dispays a Popup giving you details about the code.

In Future Updates, I plan to work on the UI and add more features to this App.
